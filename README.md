# Activity 5 - Python Exercise - Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries

## Objectives
* Demonstrate a your knowledge of how to create, modify and use python lists. 
* Demonstrate a your knowledge of how to create and use python tuples. 
* Demonstrate a your knowledge of how to create, modify and use python dictionaries. 

## Directions

There is an activity5.py program file. Erase the current code in the file and create the code to complete the following requirements.
1.	Create a List Deduplication program which eliminate any duplicates in a list and creates a new list with no duplicates.  Use the following list:
```Python
names = ['mary','mary','bill','sam','maria','kahn','bill','barry','george','hank','belinda','maria','karthik']
```
2. Sort each list.
3. Print the results which should look like the following output:

![activity5 lists-results](https://github.com/uno-isqa-4900/activity5/blob/master/images/activity5-lists-results.png)

4. The program should involve creating a deduplication function where above list is sent to the function.  The function should return the deduplicated list to be sorted and printed.

## Submitting your assignment
1. When you are happy with your working code push the code to GitHub and be sure your GitHub repository is updated.
2. Create a markdown file/document and make one or more  screenshots of the code working in the command line  (run several different grades through the program and add it to the markdown file/document labeled 4900_Activity5.
